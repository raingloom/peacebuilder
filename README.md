# peacebuilder
Build LÃ¶ve projects in peace

# Usage
 - Have a project with the following structure:
 - project
  - build: this is a clone of this repo
  - vendor: unmodified libraries, not to be included in the final `.love` file
  - a bunch of other stuff

run `bash build/build.sh` from `project`

done

(for now)

## Planned:
 - Cross platform builds
 - Custom ignores
